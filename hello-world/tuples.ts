// Tuples
// Tuples are a way to express an array with a fixed number of elements whose types are known, but need not be the same. For example, you may want to represent a value as a pair of a string and a number:
// Declare a tuple type
let user: [string, number] = ["Jeremy", 30];
// tuples are usesful when you have two value pairs that are related to each other
